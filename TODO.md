- [x] Minimum viable product
  - [x] Construct sbatch files programmatically
  - [x] Run constructed sbatch files
  - [x] Ingest YAML of schema
  - [x] Generate sbatch files from YAML
- [ ] Improvements
  - [ ] Results analysis
    - [x] Result aggregation
    - [x] Result analysis
    - [ ] Statistical re-runs
  - [ ] YAML schema
    - [x] Multiple nested arguments
    - [x] Pairwise arguments
    - [ ] Default groups for executables
    - [ ] Optional key to disable test benches in YAML
  - [ ] Optional extras
    - [x] Argument parsing from the command line
    - [ ] Unit tests
    - [ ] Documentations
    - [ ] Publish to PyPI
    - [ ] Textual TUI
      - [x] Original ideas
        - Visualise YAML schema structure
        - Spawn runs for benches/individual executables
        - View results/analysis of runs
        - Modify YAML via inbuilt editor?
      - [ ] Final plan
        - [x] Tree-style bench hierarchy explorer
          - (is this useful? perhaps better as a list?)
        - [x] Listing argument variations for test bench
        - [x] Listing sbatch file contents for run configuration
        - [x] metric table for parent test bench (even when run config selected), requires improving analysis code
        - [x] metric plotting --"--
        - [ ] run configuration/bench button to send off jobs to slurm
        - [x] modal dialog to wait on slurm queue (could be an async function?)
