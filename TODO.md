      - [x] Original ideas
        - Visualise YAML schema structure
        - Spawn runs for benches/individual executables
        - View results/analysis of runs
        - Modify YAML via inbuilt editor?
      - [x] Final plan
        - [x] Tree-style bench hierarchy explorer
          - (is this useful? perhaps better as a list?)
        - [x] Listing argument variations for test bench
        - [x] Listing sbatch file contents for run configuration
        - [x] metric table for parent test bench (even when run config selected), requires improving analysis code
        - [x] metric plotting --"--
        - [x] run configuration/bench button to send off jobs to slurm
        - [x] modal dialog to wait on slurm queue (could be an async function?)
          - [ ] Add cancel button
